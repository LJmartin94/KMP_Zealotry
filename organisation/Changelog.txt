This is just to motivate myself to improve a little bit every day :)

Best: 17

09-04-2024
Streak: 17
Learned:
Did:
    -Add a reusable 'OutlinedText' component, to display readable text against any background

08-04-2024
Streak: 16
Learned:
Did:
    -Add standard padding definitions for different screen sizes

07-04-2024
Streak: 15
Learned:
Did:
    -Split colours from theme into separate file + function
    -Make colours providable to other composables in the tree using CompositionLocalProvider
    -Make MainMenuSub component, to hold different sub menus that are displayable on the main menu
    -Add transparency to ImageButton component, make the day part menu buttons slightly transparent
    -Remove hardcoded string, allow title of SubMenu now to be passed as param

06-04-2024
Streak: 14
Learned:
    -Read about using CompositionLocal (again) - this time in the context of passing theme colours.
Did:
    -Update notes on how to improve adaptive ui - for future reference, don't want to work on it
        anymore right now.
    -Refactor MainMenu Button to a more generic & reusable ImageButton
    -Move new ImageButton composable to reusableUi directory (separate commit so history is preserved)

05-04-2024
Streak: 13
Learned:
Did:
    -Failed to make AdaptiveColumn respect Modifier.weight (to be set either within a ColumnScope
        or RowScope context)

04-04-2024
Streak: 12
Learned:
    -Read about adaptive layouts (I really should be storing screen size type,
        but am starting smaller)
Did:
    -Start implementing an 'AdaptiveColumn' which will display as column in Portrait, and as Row in
        landscape mode -WIP

03-04-2024
Streak: 11
Learned:
    -Read about compose modifiers
Did:
    -Separate Main Menu Buttons into separate file, add background image to them
    -Try to make layout work and respect individual item weights, but it is very obviously
        broken in landscape with the current setup
    -Fix menu buttons not displaying how I want, though still need to swap between row/column
        based on device orientation

02-04-2024
Streak: 10
Learned:
Did:
    -Import image resources for main menu + buttons
    -Add background image to Main Menu - static for now

01-04-2024
Streak: 9
Learned:
Did:
    -Change default colours for light mode in theme

31-03-2024
Streak: 8
Learned:
Did:
    -Just get rid of some hardcoded strings

30-03-2024
Streak: 7
Learned:
Did:
    -Set up basic navigation from Main Menu to DayPart Menu, three buttons doing the same thing

29-03-2024
Streak: 6
Learned:
Did:
    -Start implementing Navigation Host
    -Add scaffolding (just files) for Main Menu screen, and reusable screen for Morning, Midday,
        Evening Menus called DayPart Menu
    -Set up minimal placeholder for MainMenu screen, mount it to main screen on start up
    -Add 'templateComponent' to organisation directory as a quick copy-paste blue print
        for future components

28-03-2024
Streak: 5
Learned:
    -Read about Navigation Host, Graph, Controller
Did:
    -Add over-engineered 'Calendar Fragment' for displaying current day, using MVVM pattern
    -Change project structure slightly: data layer shouldn't use '@Composable' annotation,
        presentation layer should only import from data layer in ViewModels.

27-03-2024
Streak: 4
Learned:
Did:
    -Messed about with trying to set up an example component that adheres to MVVM pattern, but
        couldn't get the ViewModel class to work - something about kotlin.AutoCloseable not being
        accessible.
    -Upgrade kotlin (and its stdlib) from 1.9.22 -> 1.9.23 to fix missing AutoCloseable

26-03-2024
Streak: 3
Learned:
Did:
    -Disable precompose as it stops iOS from building
    -Start Koin on both iOS and Android (can't be done from shared code)
    -Remove special character unsupported by custom font
    -Fix sloppy precompose dependency implementations, re-enable precompose
    -Wrap the shared app component with PreComposeApp, instead of the individual Android and iOS
        apps as is done in some tutorials. I think this should work... we'll find out if it doesn't

25-03-2024
Streak: 2
Learned:
    -Read a little about dependency injection.
Did:
    -Update compose version, add koin and precompose to project.

24-03-2024
Streak: 1
Learned:
    -Read about MVVM pattern. Goal is to separate Interface and Business Logic.
        Good pattern to keep in mind, but app is not large enough to implement it yet.
Did:
    -Preliminary split (in name only) of data and presentation layers.
    -Add string localisation (using Compose Multiplatform out of the box solution).
