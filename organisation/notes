3 big topics to get right are:
* General Architecture/ project layout
* Navigation between ui.views/ screens
* State management

Adaptive UI notes -
We still need to fix the switching from portrait to landscape modes. AdaptiveColumn class didn't
work (couldn't make it respect weights for both column and row). Also the way we currently check
orientation is a bit of a hack. If there isn't a better way to do that, we should really wrap the
whole app in a BoxWithConstraints composable, and then save orientation in the global state and
reference it elsewhere, but my assumption is the whole thing can be done better anyway.
