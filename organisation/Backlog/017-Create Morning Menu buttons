Make banner for morning menu
add time to button
add basic sub menus -> In progress
- Need to make 'fab' buttons for subtasks (in reusable ui)
- Make ChecklistSubMenu use the new fabs instead of abusing IconTextTimeButton
- Rework IconTextTimeBundle to contain info on main button and subtasks, these need to be grouped to allow user customisation
- Maybe split into MainTaskBundle and SubTaskBundle, both handled from DayPartMenuButton?
- Investigate if defaultIcon can be part of itemIcons map by assert, instead of separate param
- Relevant files:
ChecklistSubmenu
DayPartMenuButton
IconTextTimeButton
DayPartMenuScreen



Done:
fix icon for cosmeticism ->
