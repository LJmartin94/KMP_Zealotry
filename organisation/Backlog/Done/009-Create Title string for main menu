proper title string for main menu (locale string with arguments, day, ordinal number, season etc)

Check if this resource says anything about handling ordinal numbers:

On localising ordinal numbers:
Different languages have different grammatical systems (and pref/suffixes) for ordinal numbers.
As part of the localiser should have some language specific logic to change 1 into 1st, 2 into 2nd etc. for English,
and other solutions for other languages.

e.g.
English: firST secoND thiRD fourTH fifTH... twenty-firST (but not elevenST) twenty-second (but not twelfND)
1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th .. 11th 12th.. 21st 22nd

For an idea of different systems implemented by different languages.

Good numbers to test Dutch and English alongside:
"1 2 3 4 8 10 11 12 13 14 20 21 22 23 24 100"

Eventually can consider replacing current implementation with:
https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/resources#string-plurals
(currently still experimental/unavailable)

Still need to:
Set right font size, set right spacing between lines and distribution of text (see also ticket 004)
