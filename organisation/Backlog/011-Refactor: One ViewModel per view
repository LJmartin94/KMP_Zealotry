Calendar repository exposes one view model for calendar fragment.
In reality the calendar fragment is not used, and the data in calendar repo is consumed from this VM
 in multiple different places instead.
These should have separate VMs associated with them,
or have it exposed at a high enough level where all children can access the state.
