Let's make the simplest app (a single toggle button) and ramp up to the required complexity from there.
Correct state management is the next hurdle to clear for our actual app, lets understand how we want it to work in the simplest case.

Data -> Domain -> UI (in terms of dependencies, and state flow)
UI -> Domain -> Data (in terms of event flow)

#Data: stores/caches data
Database
DAO

#Domain (optional): contains business logic -
should not store any data (prefer to have business logic in Data layer than vice versa)
UseCase

#UI: Only responsible for displaying latest UI state
should not update the UI state unless it is the only source of truth for the UI
Viewmodel

Step 1: Build up the data layer

//TODO: Complete the data layer implementation for example based on
// https://github.com/android/architecture-samples/tree/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/architecture/blueprints/todoapp/data

//TODO: ExampleDao Impl?, ExampleRepo Interface, ExampleRepo Impl, Network impl, Mapping funcs,

Repositories should be created per data type handled in app
