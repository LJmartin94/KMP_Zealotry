There's a whole android course on application architecture,
but for now I think it's better to just get something down.

Data -> Domain -> UI (in terms of dependencies)

#Data: stores/cahces data
Database
DAO

#Domain (optional): contains business logic -
should not store any data (prefer to have business logic in Data layer than vice versa)
UseCase

#UI: Only responsible for displaying latest UI state
should not update the UI state unless it is the only source of truth for the UI
Viewmodel
