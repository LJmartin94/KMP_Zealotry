Linter rules:
-No hardcoded strings
-data layer shouldn't use '@Composable' annotation
-presentation should never import from data layer unless in ViewModel
-No unused imports

Get rid of hardcoded strings
Set dark theme colours
Figure out how to navigate to different screens based on navigation arguments
Set transition animations
Standardise padding and font sizes, define them in a global style file that can be referenced by ui
Fix row column layouts when switching from landscape to portrait (Proper Adaptive UI impl. see notes)
Make Splash screen

Can do:
-adaptive layout for portrait/landscape
-proper title string for main menu (locale string with arguments, day, ordinal number, season etc)
-navigation
-Set up 'day' listener/observer that fetches day,
    and sets up Timer.schedule() job to fetch new day when new day changes.
    Multiple components should use this output, so flow -> sharedFlow?
